# Quackstagram Refactored

To start, run the `Quackstagram` file in `src/nl/group26/quackstagram`.

Disclaimer:
We had problems reading the files correctly on different machines. Sometimes the path of e.g. the data/credentials.txt file was not recognized correctly. We suspect that this has nothing to do with the code, as it works perfectly on at least one device. Unfortunately, we were unable to find the cause of the path problem.
